# Peer-to-Peer Plagiarism Detector

A Python-based web application that detects similarity between student submissions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system compares uploaded documents and calculates plagiarism scores using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

The app is designed for academic use and can integrate with Google Classroom to fetch submissions automatically.
